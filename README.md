# Text Generation using Deep Learning (RNN)

**Introduction:** Deep Learning is the most exciting part of Data Science and the next stage after learning Machine Learning. I have worked on this project titled “Text Generation Using Deep Learning” to apply my Deep Learning for solving a major problem in Natural Language Processing known as Language Modelling. I used Keras library to create Recurrent Neural Network model and train it with our dataset to predict text for headline.

Language Modelling is the core problem for a number of of natural language processing tasks such as speech to text, conversational system, and text summarization. A trained language model learns the likelihood of occurrence of a word/ character based on the previous sequence of words/ characters used in the text. Language models can be operated at character level, n-gram level, sentence level or even paragraph level. We will create a language model for predicting next word by implementing and training state-of-the-art Recurrent Neural Networks under Deep Learning.

**Tools used:** Python, Pandas, Numpy, NLP, Deep Learning, Tensorflow Keras, Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Long Short Term Memory networks (LSTM)
